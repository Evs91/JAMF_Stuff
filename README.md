FortiEDR stopCollector.sh to upgrade to 6.1.0.1455 for macOS 26

## 3/10/25 
FortiEDR - Tested with up to 6.0.10.1022


# Notes
Deployments of this software are either invisible or cause lots of pop ups (like most Fortinet Endpoint products for macOS).

Validate all their documentation because last I talked to support they don't have a JAMF sandbox to test anything in and they rely on customers to supply them with screenshots and other data. <sigh>
